# Python small projects
<ins>Small code projects for Python practice</ins>

This is a set of Python :snake: small projects that I decided to make in order to get some more practice with this language. :smiley:

Some of them are simple games, other are more related to simple yet useful activities (such as calculate the tip for a restaurant bill :money_with_wings:).

These projects were easy to make and allowed me to get more confident with Python :snake:.

To run them you only need to download the files, and then run them from terminal with the py command. :wink:

Example:
From your terminal, locate in the folder where you downloaded or moved the files and run the py command as I show below:

py acronym.py
